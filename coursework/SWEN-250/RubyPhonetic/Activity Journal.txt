Ruby - Phonetic

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time 1 HH 10 MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)
This program seems simple enought; I will be using the given dictionary
to complete this program and return the string equalivalents. Testing
will comply to the given parameters in the activity write-up.
 
Complete
Actual Time  1  HH 30 MM
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
 Took me a bit longer than expected due to syntax confusion. I had 
a few issues with the "upcase" function and deciding which values
passed to the two functions should be arrays or strings. In the 
end I figured it out though and I am happy with my test cases.
