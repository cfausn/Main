SWEN-250 Activity Reflection

Start
Estimated Time	2 HH 15 MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
The non-pointer problems should be pretty straight-forward. I 
plan on using contemporary programming logic to solve these 
functions (indexing, comparing etc). The pointer functions may
be a bit harder to understand though, considering I have only
briefly worked with pointers in the past. I will have to find
out how to return both pointer indexes and pointer objects in
order to solve those problems. I am pretty sure I can accomplish
this without too much hassle, but it may require me to think
out of the box compared to the more conventional functions.

Complete
Actual Time	3 HH 12 MM
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
I learned a lot about pointers with this exercise. As I suspected
the conventional functions were easy to code. But when I got down
to the pointers I was pretty stuck. After researching pointers 
for quite some time I finally discovered how to play with them in
order to get the correct results. I am really happy with what I was
able to accomplish in this program, and I feel like I learned a lot!
