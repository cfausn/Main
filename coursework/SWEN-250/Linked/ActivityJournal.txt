Start
Estimated Time	2 HH 15 MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
I don't forsee many issues with this program. All I need to do
is understand some of the syntax of custom stucts and I should
be fine (I understand -> is used to access values). I will use
a counter for the functions that require indexing and test all
functions for NULL values.

Complete
Actual Time	2 HH 32MM
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
I had little trouble with this program. Perhaps the most interesting
thing I did was use recursion for the last function. This was
my first use of recursion in C so that was sort of interesting. 
I could have used my custom free() function to free memory on these
but I decided to just use free() as it is simplier.
