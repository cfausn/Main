Start
Estimated Time	1 HH 15 MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
This seems very similar to the project. I figured out how to use 
Makefile's early so I won't have any problems there. I just have
to find out how to pass pointers correctly and then store the
variables similar to a CSV (but with $ signs).

Complete
Actual Time	1 HH 32 MM
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
My only issue with this program was understanding how to pass 
pointers to the functions. I figured out the other basic things 
like reading a line quickly because I already knew how to accomplish
that task from the Project.
