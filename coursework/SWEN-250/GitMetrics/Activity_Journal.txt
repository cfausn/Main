================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	1 HH 30 MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
I'm going to have to use DateTime in order calculate the time
between two dates and use a lot of "split()" methods in order
to get each line's data. I will have to research a lot about
DateTime to make sure that I get my values correctly.

Complete
Actual Time	1 HH 41 MM
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
I had a few issues with DateTime rounding. I wasn't sure if a 
float with a remainder (like 1.8) should round up to 2 or if it should
stay to 1. I am going to use the rounding method now because that is
what the example print-out is in the lab write-up, but I have 
talked to Prof Martinez about this and I may change it later.
