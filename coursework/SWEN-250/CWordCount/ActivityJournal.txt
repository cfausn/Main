SWEN-250 Activity Reflection

Name: Colin Fausnaught

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	00 HH 15 MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
This activity seems very straight-forward. Since I have already
completed this task in Ruby, I shouldn't have a huge issue with
translating it to C. I will make sure the characters are greater
than 0 to signify that it's not an EOF. 

Complete
Actual Time	00 HH 24 MM
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
I finished this activity quickly and easily. I used a while 
statement in conjunction with if statements in order to accomplish
my task. I had no issues with this program. I ended up changing my
while statement to use EOF per the Professor's advice.
