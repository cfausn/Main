SWEN-250 Activity Reflection

Name: Colin Fausnaught

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	2 HH 00 MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
I decided to get a head start on my programs by starting this one
a week early, so it may take me longer than the previous tasks. 
I will have to find a way to read each line and return said line
with the readline() function. I will have to search the internet
and other resources to accomplish this task. Compiler Errors: 3

I will now start Part 2, which involves storing a copy of the longest
line using the copy() function. Compiler Errors: 7

Complete
Actual Time	1 HH  22 MM
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
I learned a lot about variables with this program. I'm sure a lot
of the work I did in copy() will be utilized later with pointers,
because a lot of my compiler errors involved pointer issues
(particularly trying to cast to wrong types when I would try
to pass an int to an array value). I had a total of 10 compiler
errors throughout this program.
