SWEN-250 Activity Reflection

Name: Colin Fausnaught

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	1 HH 45 MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
The other pointer activity was very similar to this one. I think
I can use a lot of the logic that I used previously on this activity.
The only difference is I will have to use the malloc method for
strings and pointers.

Complete
Actual Time	2 HH 56 MM
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
It took a lot longer to finish this than I thought it would. However
I managed to take care of it by using a lot of the same logic
that was used in the Find activity. I had few problems coding this,
It just took me some time to change the logic from my other program.
