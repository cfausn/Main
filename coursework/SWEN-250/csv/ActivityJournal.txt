SWEN-250 Activity Reflection

Name: Colin Fausnaught

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	1 HH 15 MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
I plan on using the same tactics I used with ruby for the most 
part when it comes to reading a CSV. This shouldn't be too difficult,
I just need to find a way to simulate the "split()" method in C.

Complete
Actual Time	3 HH 15 MM
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
This project took me much longer to complete due to an error I was 
having in the while loop of get_line(). for som reason I wasn't
terminating the loop correctly using the returned value from get_field(),
and it took me hours of scouring the internet to figure it out. But
I know more about c now! So that's good I guess.
