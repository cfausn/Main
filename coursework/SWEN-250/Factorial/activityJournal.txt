WEN-250 Activity Reflection
Ruby - Factorial with Unit Testing

Name: Colin Fausnaught

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	2 HH 30 MM
Plan: Implement testing by going through the steps listed on the Factorial 
      activity. I will be testing all base cases that the program is expected
      to accomplish, and combine them in order to "break" the program 
      wherever I can.
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	1 HH  5 MM
Observations: I had a few issues with the assert_raise object, but for the most
	      part this was a decently easy program. I understood things and I 
	      am very confident in my ability to write test programs now. Startin
	      to feel like a software developer!
 
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
