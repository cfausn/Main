Home Security "C" Project - Part 1

Name: Colin Fausnaught

===========  Stage 1  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	1 HH 00 MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)
Because we have worked so frequently with CSV lines, I do not forsee
many issues with this part of the project. However I will probably
have to either make or find an equalivalent function of the "split"
function from ruby to accomplish my tasks.

Complete
Actual Time	4 HH 30 MM
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
I had a lot of issues with this part of the project. Particularly
because I had a lot of issues with the CSV inputs. I ended up reading
about pointers and using those for the CSV input. Now I will have
to move these values into the data structures specified in the other
stages of the program. (ratio 4.5)

===========  Stage 2  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	1 HH 15 MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)
I need to start using the structs specfied in the program in order
to accomplish this stage of the project. I can repurpose a lot
of the code already used in the previous stage to accomplish this.

Complete
Actual Time	1 HH 45 MM
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
This part wasn't nearly as hard as the first. The logic was easily
transfered over from the first stage. I think I over-coded a lot
of this stage but I don't understand how I can make it easier. I 
may need to consider using another function in the future to get 
rid of all the long code. (ratio 1.4)

===========  Stage 3  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	00 HH 30 MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)
I only have to add another loop to my already existing code in 
order to accomplish the task in this stage. It doesn't seem 
complicated at all because my current code already accomplishes a 
lot of the tasks I was supposed to implement in this part. 

Complete
Actual Time	00 HH 20 MM
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
Just as I expected this stage took little to no time to complete.
All I had to do was change my coding for the "counter" variable.
I have to now update my code to deal with overflowing buffers.
(ratio 0.6)


===========  Stage 4  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	00 HH 45 MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)
I have to figure out how to excede the buffer size in this part
of the project. I will probably have to use the other two unused
variables in the struct to accomplish this task.

Complete
Actual Time	00 HH 25 MM
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
Just as I suspected this Stage was simple. All I had to do was add
an if statement to the beginning of my code to move the buffers
up. I am pretty sure that this will actually work perfectly for the
next part too. (ratio 0.5)

===========  Stage 5  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	01 HH 45 MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, estimation technique)
All my code up to this point should work for this stage as well.
However I just realized I forgot to make alerts for temperature
and carbon monoxide. I will have to implement that before I continue.
I will also be cleaning my code at this level so it may take longer
than expected.
Complete
Actual Time	01 HH 30 MM
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
This part was simple (all I had to do was fix an earlier FUPA), so
I took the oppurtunity to take care of documentation. I cleaned it 
up the best I could (even though I didn't use a function and my code
doesn't look necessarily beautiful). I am consistently getting the
correct results from my test programs so I am happy to consider the
project finished! I even did a makefile. Time to reflect... (ratio 0.85)

===========  PROJECT PART 1 SUMMARY REFLECTION  =======================
For some reason the first part of this project took me a considerable
amount of time. I had a lot of issues with CSVs (even though we worked
on them in the past) but I managed to work through it. I also had issues
with understanding the function given to me to fill in. So instead
of using that function (which I felt was too confusing) I created my own
way to solve the problem. I liked doing it this way because it allowed me
to code more efficiently in the long run. This way I only had to change
my code to a very minimal amount for each stage.
The time difference was interesting. In the end I had 5 HH 15 MM estimated,
8 HH 30 MM actual (1.6 ratio). The time differences got a lot smaller as I
continued on. I think this is because I designed my code from the get-go to 
allow for adaptability. At every step I tried to think ahead since I spent
so much time on the first step. This helped me in the long-run I think.
