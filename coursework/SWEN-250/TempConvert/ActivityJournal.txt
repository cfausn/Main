SWEN-250 Activity Reflection

Name: Colin Fausnaught

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	01 HH 45 MM
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
I plan on working through part 1 using the activity outline. It 
shouldn't be too difficult, but since I am unfamiliar with C I
will probably have to take more time to complete this task.
Part 2 will be simple because it is basically the same as the
first program, but in floating point.

Complete
Actual Time	00 HH 45 MM
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
Took me much shorter than I originally thought. I had a few issues
with formatting my output, but besides that I had no issues. Fun
little project!
