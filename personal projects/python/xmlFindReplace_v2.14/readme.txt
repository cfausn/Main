XML_Converter_Tool_v2.14

Created by Colin Fausnaught
Revised 4/9/15

In order to run the file the first time you may need to follow these steps:
	
	1) Open Terminal
	2) Type "chmod +x " (DONâ€™T PRESS ENTER YET)
	3) Drag the XML_Converter_Tool_v2.command into the Terminal Window
	4) Press enter

The file should then open when you double click the XML_Converter_Tool_v2.14.command file.

Corrected files will be saved in the same directory of the selected files. I have included the .py file if you are interested in checking out the code. 

Please let me know if you find any errors!
